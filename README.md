# Twitch-Plays-GUI
Twitch Plays code for DirectX games with user-friendly GUI


Twitch-Plays-GUI allows you to connect your Twitch chat directly to your DirectX game (specifically GTAV). With an easy-to-use interface, you can choose which commands your Twitch viewers can use, as well as change the names of specific commands to whatever you want them to be. You don't like typing in 'left' to turn left? How about 'loosy goosy'? You can do it in Twitch-Plays-GUI!

How to get started:
Simply download each of the files within the repository (TwitchPlays.py, TwitchPlays_AccountInfo.py, and TwitchPlays_Connection.py), and update the TwitchPlays_AccountInfo.py file with your Twitch username and OAuth token. Then just run TwitchPlays.py alongside GTAV and your Twitch stream, that's it!

This program was a combination of a project by Wituz and DougDoug, with the GUI created by ClassyWeasel. If you have any questions or problems, contact one of the contributors.
